# Company Bankruptcy Risk Modeling API

## Project Overview

This project develops and deploys a machine learning API for the prediction task of **risk modeling**. The API predicts the **probability of company bankruptcy** using selected financial features from the **Company Bankruptcy Prediction** dataset. The model is served through **FastAPI**.

## Users

The main users of this service are:

- Financial analysts
- Banks and lenders
- Investors
- Business consultants and auditors
- Developers integrating the API into other systems

## Setup Instructions 

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### 3. Run the API

```

### 4. Open the API documentation

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```


## API Documentation
This project uses FastAPI, which automatically generates interactive API documentation at:

- /docs

The /docs endpoint shows the available endpoints, request body format, response format, and allows live testing of the API.

## API Performance

The API is designed for real-time prediction. Performance can be measured using response time and memory usage while the FastAPI service is running. Since Logistic Regression is a lightweight model, the service is expected to respond quickly with low resource usage.
